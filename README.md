# Fishy-Game

This game was an assignment for my Fundatmentals of Computer Science 2 class, and runs as a Java Application in Eclipse.

In this game, you are a small fish in a big pond. You are able to eat fish that are smaller than you (and grow), but if you try to eat a fish that is larger than you, you will be eaten! You win when you are the largest fish in the pond.
